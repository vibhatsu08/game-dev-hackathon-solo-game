Title - Iron Man : Machine Mayhem </br>
In this repository I will be documenting and storing all my files for the progress done in the 24 hours of this solo self created game development hackathon. The main objective of this self started hackathon is for me to finally get started with game development in Python with Python's rich libraries that would enable me to do so.
